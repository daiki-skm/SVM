# SVM

## What is SVM?
It is supervised learning and can handle classification and regression, but it is mainly used for classification tasks.  
First, the Support Vector, which appears in the name of the algorithm, is the data point closest to the straight line that divides the data.  
Also, once the support vector is defined and the dividing line is determined, we can predict which class the point belongs to based on whether it is above or below this line.  

## Result
Accuracy for Training Data: 0.97  
Accuracy for Test Data: 0.93
